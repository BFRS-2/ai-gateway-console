# CLAUDE.md — [App Name]

## App Identity

- **App**: [app-name]
- **Purpose**: [1-2 sentences describing what this app does and for whom]
- **Stack**: React [version] with [Vite|Next.js|Create-React-App] (TypeScript [version])
- **State Management**: [Redux Toolkit|Zustand|React Query|Context-only|other]
- **Team**: [Owner team]
- **Backend**: [API service name(s) consumed]

## ADLC Rule Pointers

All execution protocol, security rules, and language patterns are governed by ADLC global rules.
This file does NOT restate them.

**Always loaded** (via symlink, no action needed):
- `~/.claude/rules/baseline/security.md` — Security checks, PII rules, pre-commit checklist
- `~/.shiprocket/adlc/rules/operational/development-workflow.md` — Mode detection, Phase 0–1

**Loaded when coding (Phase 2+ only)**:
- `~/.shiprocket/adlc/rules/operational/development-workflow-impl.md` — Phases 2–6, gates, TDD, commits, PRs
- `~/.shiprocket/adlc/rules/language-specific/react-patterns.md` — Naming, hooks, async state, P3/P4 testing

> This file does not describe phases, gates, approval flows, naming conventions, commit format,
> TDD instructions, or security rules. Those live in the files above and apply automatically.

## Knowledge Base Navigation

**Auto-loaded every session** (no action needed):
- `@knowledge-base/00-system-context.md` — Stack, key dependencies, app metadata

**Read when the current task requires it** (Phase 2+ only, not at session start):

| Task Involves | Read This KB File |
|---|---|
| App architecture, component tree, state shape | `knowledge-base/00-system-architecture.md` |
| Technology stack, dependency versions | `knowledge-base/01-system-tech-stack.md` |
| Directory structure, layer descriptions | `knowledge-base/01-system-source-tree.md` |
| API consumed (endpoints, schemas, auth) | `knowledge-base/02-api-contracts.md` |
| State shape (Redux slices, Zustand stores) | `knowledge-base/02-data-models.md` |
| Business rules, access control on the client | `knowledge-base/03-biz-domain-rules.md` |
| Critical user journeys (login, checkout, etc.) | `knowledge-base/03-biz-critical-flows.md` |
| Non-obvious bugs, browser quirks, past incidents | `knowledge-base/04-eng-gotchas.md` |
| Naming conventions, code review checklist | `knowledge-base/04-eng-conventions.md` |
| Test strategy (RTL, Cypress/Playwright, MSW) | `knowledge-base/04-eng-testing-guide.md` |
| Feature changelog, recent significant changes | `knowledge-base/05-meta-changelog.md` |

**Loading rule**: Do not read KB files at session start. Read only when the task explicitly
requires that topic. State which file you are reading and why before opening it.

**If a KB file is an empty stub**: Do not load it. Note it is unpopulated and proceed with
code-level analysis. Routing to empty stubs adds noise, not context.

## Response Style

[Specify preferences. Example: "≤150 words per response. No trailing summaries. No tradeoff
discussion unless asked. Expand only on follow-up."]

## App Architecture

[3–5 sentences describing the app design. Examples:]

```
Vite + React 18 SPA consuming the orders/users/notifications REST API.
State managed via Redux Toolkit (RTK Query for cache, slices for UI state).
Routing via React Router 6. Auth via JWT in httpOnly cookies; API calls go through axios interceptor.
Optimistic updates on like/favorite/cart actions with explicit rollback on API failure.
```

[Or for Next.js:]

```
Next.js 14 App Router with React Server Components for data fetching.
Client Components only where interactivity is needed (forms, modals, charts).
Server Actions for mutations; revalidation via revalidatePath.
TypeScript strict mode; tailwind for styling.
```

## Risk Escalation Files

Modifying any file in this table automatically escalates `risk_level` to HIGH and requires
the full agent pipeline, regardless of estimated scope.

| File | Size | Why High Risk |
|---|---|---|
| [TODO: src/api/client.ts] | [XX KB] | [Reason: e.g., axios instance + interceptors used by every request] |
| [TODO: src/store/authSlice.ts] | [XX KB] | [Reason: e.g., auth state shared across the app] |

## Structural Map

Key files Claude reads first (Vite/CRA layout):
- `src/main.tsx` or `src/index.tsx` — entry point, root mount, providers
- `src/App.tsx` — top-level route configuration
- `src/components/` — presentational components, organized by feature
- `src/hooks/` — custom hooks (data fetching, derived state, side effects)
- `src/store/` or `src/state/` — Redux slices or Zustand stores
- `src/api/` — typed API clients (axios/fetch wrappers)
- `src/pages/` or `src/routes/` — route-level container components

Key files (Next.js App Router):
- `app/layout.tsx` — root layout, providers
- `app/<route>/page.tsx` — server components for routes
- `app/api/<route>/route.ts` — API routes (BFF)
- `components/` — shared UI; `lib/` — helpers; `hooks/` — custom hooks

Layers and their purpose:
- **Components** → presentation; props-only when possible
- **Hooks** → custom logic, data fetching wrappers, derived state
- **Store / State** → global cache (RTK Query) and UI state (slices/Zustand)
- **API** → typed wrappers around fetch/axios; never bare fetch in components
- **Tests** → `*.test.tsx` colocated; RTL for components, MSW for API mocking

## Upstream Dependencies

[List backend services this app calls. Example:]
- `orders-api` — REST: `/api/orders`, `/api/orders/:id`
- `auth-service` — JWT issuance, refresh

## Domain Terms

[App-specific glossary. Example:]
- **Optimistic Update** — UI state changes before API confirms; rollback on failure required
- **Settlement Cycle** — daily 24h window; affects which orders are editable

## Run / Test / Build

```bash
# Install
npm ci

# Dev server
npm run dev          # vite or next dev

# Test
npm test             # jest + RTL
npm run test:e2e     # cypress or playwright

# Build (production)
npm run build        # vite build / next build
npm run preview      # serve the built bundle
```

## Known Gotchas

[App-specific quirks. Examples:]
- **Strict Mode double-render**: effects fire twice in dev — make all effects idempotent
- **Optimistic update without rollback**: see `react-patterns.md §P4`. Use the demo pattern in `tests/scenario_react_p4_rollback/demo.js`
- **httpOnly cookie auth**: cannot read from JS — handle 401s by redirecting, not by reading cookie state
